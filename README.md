# AngularEcomm

This e-commerce application, built with Angular 19, utilizes Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design. Users can browse a product catalog with detailed stock and pricing information, add items to the shopping cart, and see a dynamically updated cart total, ensuring a smooth and interactive shopping experience.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.9.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Next Possible Features

Here are some potential enhancements for future iterations of **AngularEcomm**:

- **Implementing a Component Library** – Integrate Material Design or another component library for a more consistent UI.
- **Loaders & Notifications** – Improve user experience with loading indicators and real-time notifications.
- **Server-Side Integrations + Payments** – Enable backend integrations for payment processing and order management.
- **Forms for Customer Info** – Implement structured forms for user details and checkout processes.

These additions would enhance functionality and improve overall usability.
